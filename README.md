_Node centers for nodes in the quadtree._

This project is a quadtree implementation in C++.
It is designed to immerse an arbitrary polygon and create a two-dimensional structured mesh.

Currently (June 2018), the functionality includes:
* Specification of a 2D polygon,
* Refining nodes by one level,
* Refinement of the entire domain.
